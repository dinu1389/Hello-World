## How to Use These Deliverables

### For Immediate Editing
1. Open individual chapter DOCX files from `/chapters/`
2. Reference `IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` for phase-by-phase approach
3. Use `JANTAR_MANTAR_SUGGESTIONS.md` for specific text examples
4. Start with Phase 1 high-priority additions

### For Understanding Context
1. Review `BOOK_INDEX.md` for overall story structure
2. Read `JANTAR_MANTAR_SUGGESTIONS.md` background sections
