#### Issues in Original PDF:
1. **Duplicate chapter numbers**: Multiple chapters with the same number but different titles
2. **Inconsistent numbering**: Chapters 8, 9, and 10 appeared multiple times
3. **Multiple versions**: The PDF contained what appeared to be multiple drafts/versions combined
4. **No clear Table of Contents**: No unified TOC for the complete book

#### Corrections Applied:
1. **Sequential chapter numbering**: All chapters are now numbered 1-11 in order
